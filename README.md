# Facebook Bliss: Mass Unfollow / Follow Tool

All of the answers are within you. Silence the noise and live your own life.

Facebook is a drug dealer. She deals you hits of dopamine. Only now are we discovering just how addicting the news feed of attention can really be. Observe yourself. How many times have you involuntarily reflexed, tapping the Facebook icon on your phone? Or typing f [enter] in your browser? Only in real moments of self-awareness do we see how she's become a subconscious reflex. Wake up, zombie. Keep the love and remove the venom.

This plugin effectively gets rid of your news feed. That way when you do load Facebook, your attention isn't hijacked. You can still view profiles of all of your friends. You can still RSVP to events. You just won't be distracted by the algorithm that pulls your attention down a tunnel.

It's all reversible, so if you do want your feed back, click click click, and you've got it. You're in control. Make conscious decisions, and live your best life.
